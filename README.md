 I made a simple Chrome extension that allows you to see your chosen stockâ€™s: 
 1. target prices assigned by top investment analysts
 2. the most important company news
 3. analyst estimates for your chosen stock.

If you are interested in the step-by-step process on how to build this extension, you can read my article <a href="https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/how-to/how-to-create-your-own-stock-analysis-chrome-extension">How to Create Your Own Stock Analysis Chrome Extension.</a>

If you want to see a practical application of this extension, read my article <a href="https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/how-to/how-to-forecast-stock-prices-using-fmp-news-stock-price-targets-and-financial-statements-estimates">How to forecast stock prices using FMP news, stock price targets, and financial statements estimates.</a>

If you donâ€™t want to build this extension but want to use it, download it from the Chrome Web Store, itâ€™s called <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/stock-news-and-forecast-e/giliocmealnhiegcjafllopfbcfnnnpo">Stock News and Forecast Extension.</a>
